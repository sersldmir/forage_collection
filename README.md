A project for Citi ICG Technology Software Development virtual internship (provided by Forage)

It's a JavaFX desktop app for monitoring 3 stocks from NSE: TITANEQN, LTEQN, LTIMEQN. I changed the task a bit, because the provided api didn't work, so I had to improvise :).
The killer feauture is gracefully handed real time monitoring + free api
