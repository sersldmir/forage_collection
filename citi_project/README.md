# forage_collection
A collection of Forage projects 

[Forage](https://www.theforage.com/course-catalog) is a provider of free virtual internships that offers opportunities to experience tasks similar to some workplace

Folders represent different projects, i. e. job simulations, and each has a description, so I won't repeat myself here :)

# citi_project
A project for Citi ICG Technology Software Development virtual internship (provided by Forage) - [source](https://www.theforage.com/virtual-internships/prototype/2jxESPvorR7fmypXj/ICG-O&T-Software-Development?ref=NNMZye38neDkk9h92)

It's a JavaFX desktop app for monitoring 3 stocks from NSE: TITANEQN, LTEQN, LTIMEQN. I changed the task a bit, because the provided api didn't work, so I had to improvise :).
The killer feauture is gracefully handed real time monitoring + free api
